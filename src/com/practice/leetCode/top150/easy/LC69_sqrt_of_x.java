/**
 * Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x
 * rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer
 * should be non-negative as well.

 * You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

 * For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in
 * python.

 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= x <= 231 - 1
