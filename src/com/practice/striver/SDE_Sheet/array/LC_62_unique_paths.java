/**
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially
 * located at the top left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot
 * tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n
 * - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible
 * unique paths that the robot can take to reach the
 * bottom-right corner.

 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less
 * than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

 * Input: m = 3, n = 7
 * Output: 28

 * Input: m = 3, n = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3
 * ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right
 * 3. Down -> Right -> Down

 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
