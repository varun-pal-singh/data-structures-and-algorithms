/**
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map
 * where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it
 * can trap after raining.

 * Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is
 * represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case,
 * 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

 * Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
 * Output: 9

 * Constraints:
 * n == height.length
 * 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 105
