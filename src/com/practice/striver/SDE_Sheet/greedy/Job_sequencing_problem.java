/**
 * Problem Statement: You are given a set of N jobs where each
 * job comes with a deadline and profit. The profit can only be
 * earned upon completing the job within its deadline. Find the
 * number of jobs done and the maximum profit that can be
 * obtained. Each job takes a single unit of time and only one
 * job can be performed at a time.

 * Input: N = 4, Jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}

 * Output: 2 60

 * Explanation: The 3rd job with a deadline 1 is performed
 * during the first unit of time .The 1st job is performed
 * during the second unit of time as its deadline is 4.
 * Profit = 40 + 20 = 60

 * Input: N = 5, Jobs = {(1,2,100),(2,1,19),(3,2,27),(4,1,25),(5,1,15)}

 * Output: 2 127

 * Explanation: The  first and third job both having a deadline
 * 2 give the highest profit.
 * Profit = 100 + 27 = 127
